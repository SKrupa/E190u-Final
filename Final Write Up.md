##Introduction

For a final design project, I wanted to build off of Labs 1 and 2 since I enjoyed being able to work in both hardware and software. I decided to create a combination of a handheld console and a wireless touchscreen controller for PC. I would implement the console by attaching the Jetson TK1 to it, enabling it to run a variety of ARM compatible games. Furthermore, there are lots of emulators writter for ARM computers because of the rise of mobile gaming platforms.

##Design Methodology
I also liked the idea of being able to use the controller with a more powerful PC in much the same way the Wii U tablet controller works in conjunction with a Wii U. I felt that getting a game streaming to the Jetson without large amounts of latency was outside of the scope of this project, so instead I focused on simply getting user inputs from the controller to the PC.

Ultimately, this controller is intended to be protable in the way a laptop is portable rather than how other game consoles like the PlayStation Portable or the Gameboy series are portable.
